                      		 Camel-Hazelcast

Overview
======

Camel-Hazelcast component implements a work-queue on top of the Hazelcast in-memory data-grid.
Its purpose is to support asynchronous SEDA architectures, similar to the core "SEDA" component.
By making use of Hazelcast's implementation of BlockingQueue, it allows the system to scale
across multiple machines with minimal or no configuration while the replication features provided
increase reliability and fault-tolerance.

For more information on Hazelcast please refer to : http://www.hazelcast.com/.
